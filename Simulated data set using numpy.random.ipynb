    "After some research into the GMIT staff data I discovered that currently 21% of academic staff hold a PhD, 62% hold a Master's Degree, and the remainder an Honours Degree. I also found that the gender breakdown in academic staff is 40% male, 60% female. After running the above code I realised that I need to look at the relationship between age & qualification, as, for example, a 25 year old staff member is unlikely to hold a PhD, given that the acadmic minimum requirements are a qualification to at least Level 8 plus three years experience. A Level 8 qualification generally takes 3/4 years, a Masters degree another one, and a PhD at least another 3/4, so the minimum age of a PhD holder employed by GMIT in an academic role cannot be less than 27. I couldn't find any recent data on the average age of completion of a PhD, however the median age of a PhD student in Ireland was 26.5 years in 2013, and in 1997 the typical age of a PhD graduate in Ireland was between 24 & 27.
